Collected EEG signals from occipital regions using gold cup electrodes and a Cyton board (250 Hz).

Applied Butterworth filters for noise reduction and extracted key EEG components (4â€“35 Hz).

Implemented and compared CCA and FFT methods to decode SSVEP frequencies with high accuracy.

Transmitted motion commands via Bluetooth to demonstrate reliable and precise human-machine interaction.
