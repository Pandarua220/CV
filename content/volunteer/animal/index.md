“Where Are the Fantastic Beasts?” is a Public Welfare Campaign for Animal Protection. The event focuses on the adoption and rescue of stray dogs, helping them live happily. Volunteers promote the concept of civilized dog ownership, popularize legal dog keeping, guide dog owners to apply for dog licenses online, and advise them to have microchips implanted in their dogs. In addition, we call for "adoption instead of purchase" and spread the civilized concepts of cherishing life, treating life kindly, and equality of all lives.
