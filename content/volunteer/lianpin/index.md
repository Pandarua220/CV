During the summer vacation, we brought warmth and scientific knowledge to local children in Lianping County, aiming to enhance their scientific literacy, broaden their academic horizons and expand their knowledge reserves. We also built friendships with them and touched each other's hearts with sincerity. Meanwhile, teachers and students carried out rural research activities: they went deep into rural areas to understand the current situation of local residents in Lianping and the county's characteristic industries, striving to contribute to Lianping's rural revitalization from their own professional perspectives.
