Recruit volunteers to go to autism intervention and rehabilitation institutions to assist teachers. In this activity, volunteers are expected to treat children with autism with the love, patience, and sense of responsibility rooted in tolerance, understanding, and acceptance. By accompanying the children in activities such as chatting, studying, and playing games, volunteers will help the children feel warm care, open up their hearts, step out of their inner world as much as possible, and integrate into the broader society.
