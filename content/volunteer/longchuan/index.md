Organized a volunteer program supporting 102 primary school students, overseeing the entire process from planning and execution to evaluation and presentation. During the planning phase, I drafted activity proposals, developed contingency plans, recruited and trained volunteers, and arranged logistics schedules; in day-to-day operations, I coordinated accommodation arrangements, assigned classes, conducted daily debriefs, and supervised the development of surveys and outreach materials; post-program, I further compiled financial documents, drafted research reports, and presented the program’s key outcomes.
